        <name>Express BodyParser Tempfile Creation Issue</name>
        <regex>bodyParser\(\)</regex>
        <rule_desc>Detects the usage of bodyParser() in Express, which may lead to a tempfile creation issue.</rule_desc>
        <vuln_desc>If this rule matches, it indicates the potential vulnerability of a tempfile creation issue in Express due to the usage of bodyParser(). Attackers can potentially exploit this issue to manipulate or abuse temporary files, leading to security vulnerabilities such as file disclosure or remote code execution.</vuln_desc>
        <developer>Developers should update to a more recent version of Express and use alternative middleware options like express.json() or express.urlencoded() instead of bodyParser(). It is important to ensure that the application handles file uploads and temporary files securely, following best practices such as proper file validation, secure file storage, and limiting file access permissions.</developer>
        <reviewer>Reviewers should verify that developers have addressed the tempfile creation issue in Express by updating to a newer version and using safer alternatives to bodyParser(). They should also assess the implementation of file handling and storage in the application to ensure that best practices are followed, minimizing the risk of file-related vulnerabilities.</reviewer>
